My experiments with ECG classification using Tree-based and 1D CNN models. The Tree-based model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the validation dataset whereas the CNN model achieved an accuracy of 90%. 

The ECG data was sourced from https://figshare.com/collections/ChapmanECG/4560497/2. It contains 12-lead ECGs of 10,646 patients with 500 Hz sampling rate that features 11 common rhythms and 67 additional cardiovascular conditions, all labeled by professional experts.
